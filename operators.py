#we use logical  and operators (and) where we use and.
print(True and True)#e.g a man and aman:
print(True and False)
#another logical or operators:
print(True or False)# the answer will always be true
#logical "not"
print( not True)
#atleast each sentences will have an operators as we do programming.


#membership operators are identified with in/not in 
mylist=[10,20,30,40,50]
print(10 in mylist)#we are asking if 10 is a member of mylist
print(100  not in mylist)

#identity operators:, here we have a looking at identity of variables.

print(mylist is not mylist2)  
print(mylist is mylist2)
print(False and False)
print(not False)

#a statement that eveluates to a value is called an expression.
#an operator is something what tells a computer what to do with operand(values.) 
#an operator acts upon an operand.
#a value in programming is called an operand.
#simple assignment about bi-wise operators.

#Loops and conditions:
#a loop is  something that instructs  the computer   repeatedly until something/ condition  is  false.(the false condition will trigger it (computer) to stop)
