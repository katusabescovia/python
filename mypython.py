#my experience from dayone to upto now what i learnt in python class
# I learnt programming is not a war but is just interesting where programming is art and science of writing computer instructions we pay attention on computer memory.
# I learnt HTML  is mark up language which uses text to present other texts.
#CSS is cascading style sheet which is made by spread over with different styles.
#I learnt similarity between human and computer e.g both have memory and have brain etc.
#i also learnt if i want to become  the best programmer i have to put the followwing into practice  forexample patience ,logical, pratice as possible as i can.
#I also learnt how  brain works with a memory where brain picks information from the memory.
#   A memory  store instructions or information.
#I learnt different types of memory and their examples Optical memory reads and writes on its example include DVD and CD,Material drive which writes and read from it using electromagnetic fields which includes Hard Disk Drive, Flash Drive is used for copying,writting and read from it .
#The memory of computer is called CPU- central processing unit.
#I also learnt categories of memory forexample Primary and secondary memory where Hard disk is a primary memory and RAM is a secondary memory.
#I also learnt a computer cannot work if there is no RAM.
#I learnt RAM and Hard disk drive is an internal memory while CD and Flash drive is an external memory.
#I  learnt The CPU cannot directly communicate with the Hard disk drive but can access it through RAM.
#A cache store files that are usually opened.
#I learnt when the CPU is not working RAM is empty while when the computer is switched  off RAM is empty.
#I also learnt when you open any document RAM is active.
# I learnt Buffa memory is a memory that stores work before temporary saving.
#I also learnt Hard Disk Drive is a material drive reads, lights using electromagnetic fields. This works after applying electricity onto the header of the hard disk drive.
#Hard disk drive should be able to go uder process of partition inorder to store information on it.
#partition enables to create small parts on the hard forexample different files on the hard
#we partition inorder to store information in the ordered manner.
# After partition  we   identify each spaces  and give it name on the memory.
#I also learnt that this identifier can be added  a name on top of it forexample variable  added  a value on top of it.
#I also learnt when the RAM is full the cpu will tell me the memory of the computer is full.
# I also learnt when you keep opening the files to every time the address will be transfer  from RAM and stored to cache.
#I also learnt  when you open any application such as VScode, Excel address will be transferred to  RAM and then you open a file within vscode , excel the address is located in buffer.BUffer new file can be stored when data is transferred from one data to another.
#I learnt python is an interpreted language.
#I learnt syntax in python are rules that governs , follow while writing codes in python and also syntax in python is easy to read,understand and write.
#I learnt how to download python and i was able to download python 3.12.2
# i learnt we can open python through interpreter mode  and inscript mode.
#i also learnt the name of this arrows >>>  in command prompt are called severalrot.
# i learnt my first command and that is print  where we write parenthessis after it.
# Ilearnt a statement is complete instruction to the computer and also what we write in python is called statement .
#I learnt two or more statements in python make up acode.
# i also learnt more pieces of code in the file make up a programming.
#i also learnt name given to python file is called python script.
#i learnt syntax of variables where variables are names a programmers give to the memory spaces of the computer memory.
#i learnt comments in python are written specifically to show what  human what you are talking about.
#I lerarnt different syntax of variables as shown below:
#variable syntax for python(# represents a comment)
#variable names should not start with special characters , e.g (#,)
#variable  name should not start with a numerical number e.g(1 number, 2number) 
#however, number 1, number 2 is a valid  syntax.
#a variable name should not have spaces  e.g my gender
#composite variable names should be separated by an underscore e.gmy_gender
#or you can use camels-case notation, e.gmyGender
#names should not start with capital letters unless they are functions or classes e.g (Myname)
#use shorter names  instead of my gender you can use gender
#I also learnt sign of =is called  assignment operators.
#I also learnt assignment operators is used to give a variable a value.
#I learnt different datatypes in python forexample  sequences, numeric, string, mapping and sets,boolean.
# I learnt Datatypes defines the size of memory and enable us to manage  efficiently our memory spaces.
#Ilearnt  different numerics datatypes where we have intergers, complex numbers and floating numbers.
# i also learnt intergers are values without decimal places e.g 2 while floating numbers are values with decimal points e.g 2.0
#I learnt  string as a datatype which is a group of characters and is represented by "" or''
#i also learnt semantic is the meaning of what you have written.
# I learnt typecasting which enables to change from one variable to another variablee.g string to numeric or it can be defined as conversion of the values from different variable to be stored in different variables.
# i learnt about sequences as a datatypes which includes lists, tuples, sets
# i learnt lists are variable that can store more than one values.
#I also learnt in lists we can add or remove values and that is called mutable.
#Lists are identified by square brackets e.g[] and also we can add values in lists using append command.
# i learnt we can index our lists elements where it is refers position given to value given to variables.
#I learnt tuples are immmutable is where you cannot add or remove values.
# i learnt also we can change a list to a list bit we cannot change alist into a tuple is presented by ()
#i also learnt about sets which is an unordered collection of unigue of values and it is presented by braces brackets{}
#I learnt mapping is identified by dictionary datatypes.
# I Learnt dictionary is written using keys and values and also represented by {}
#I also learnt operators that is defined by  special variable that tells a computer what to do with values.
# I learnt different operators symbol  and their special meaning.
#Arithematic operators(+,-,*,/.//) perform arithmetic operatorations on numbers forexample + is for summation,-is for subtraction *for multiplications / for division // for floor division and % for modulo , **for power or exponential.
