# I learnt  Object Orientated programming is a idea that avocates  for the developing of software based on real world objects.
# I also learnt different principles of  object oriented programming as mentioned below
#polymophism ,inheritance,Abstraction,encapsulation.

# I learnt that class is a blue print of an object
# i also learnt class car has an objects such as involing different types of cars such as ranger rovers.
# I learnt objects takes on all feature  an objects. but each objects  has its own attributes , properties
# I  learnt  a class is a group of objects and an object is an instance of a class
#a complete of set of attributes are an object.
#class will have an attribute 0f animal are  name,age,color,number of legs 
# i also learnt how to identify class of an object by using a phrase 'is a' forexample  cat 'is a' Animal therefore  cat is a class of Animal
# I also learnt how we  identify classes we concrete on abstraction which refers to the ability of concreting of highest level of representation of what you are talking about.
#class names are  singular e.g cat not cats and should start with capital letter.
#abstract are only limited to classes
#I also learnt that  inheritance is ability by an object to  be taken on different attributes  of a class forexample cat here we dealing with parent and a child  forexample car is a parent of  range rover.
#polymorphism refers to the ability to take  on different attributes of a class.
# encapulsion is  bility to have what to say and not what to say(share)
# I learnt that  we define a class  by writing class followed by name class name and it should be started with capital letter and then full name and is identified by full column.
# I learnt that variables are  called  attributes in classes and while  functions are called methods in classes and everything  or statement written within methods are called behaviour.
# I learnt that  class is also  block of code features of a class are identified by dot operators.
#I also learnt that f string is used to combine different data types and + operator is used to connect variables with same datetype  forexample string and  a string.

#accessing attributes of  objects  is by  excusting them and learnt that a complete set of values is an object
   # I also learnt that  turtle is design  graphical used in python and also learnt different  attributes of turtle forexample colors, circle  shapes,  and we played with its functionality of  it's attributes and  we  managed to design  olypics.
