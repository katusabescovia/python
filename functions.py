#functions named block of code is called functions:
#a function is a group of code related to one another and performing a specific task:
#functions are the building blocks of programming languages
#forexample
#def function  function is identified by the word def followed by named function of your choose then followed by ()
def my_functions():#function after writing you should put ()
    num1,num2,=20,40,# what we have written is below is called indention:
    print(num1+num2)
my_functions() #what we have written above is called static function are defined by ()
#we have two  types of functions #static and dynamic function: has a content within ihe parenthesses ("dynamic")  
def condition():
    number = 10
    if number  > 0:
        print("numer is positive")  
    print("if the statement is easy")
      #is idenpendent conditions.it can be printed.   fro line 12-15is called  function definition: by statement below after defining functiion: everything you indent beloow a function is called function definition.a function is defined but not created.
#condition() 

#below code has been extractd from the function:
number=10
if number >0:
    print("number is positive") 
condition() 
#function indention is identified by :   
"""function condition (){this is how they write functions in javascript. in python we use : and indent.}
"""   
#the calling of the function is called INVOKE   in programming language.We are learning function attaching it with conditions.
