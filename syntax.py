#variable syntax for python(# represents a comment)
#variable names should not start with special characters , e.g (#,@,$,*)
#variable  name should not start with a numerical number e.g(1 number, 2number) 
#however, number 1, number 2 is a valid  syntax.
#a variable name should not have spaces  e.g (my age, my name)
#composite variable names should be separated by an underscore e.g(my_age, my_name)
#or you can use camels-case notation, e.g(myAge, myName)
#names should not start with capital letters unless they are functions or classes e.g (Myname)
#we should use relatable names e.g when dealing with a customer , call them mycustomer,when dealing with numbers use numl,num2
#use shorter names e.g (cust for customer, age instead of myage)
#variable name should not repeated  in different forms bescause python is case sensitive, e.g ('Name' and 'name' are not the same)
age=20
gender="female"
name="scovia"
print(age)
print(name)
print(gender)
print(age,name,gender)
#declaring variable is the process of creating the computer name in memory space.
#initializing variable is the process of giving variables a value. e.g('age' is a variable, 20 is it's value)
